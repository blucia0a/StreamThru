#Copyright Brandon Lucia 2010
#
#I wrote this program so I could listen to records in my living room.
#The main idea is that you connect something you want to hear somewhere
#else to your computer's default line in or microphone or whatever (the
#default input).  Then you run capture.sh, which will grab the audio from
#that thing (using sox).  Pipe the output of capture.sh to streamthru.pl.
#Then, go into the other room with your other computer, and run
#
#  curl <host running streamthru.pl>:8000 | play -b -u -a -c2 -4 -twav -r44100 -V10 -
#
#All those options to `play` match the ones in capture.sh.  V10 makes the 
#volume increase by a factor of 10.  you can read the docs on sox.

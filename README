#StreamThru.pl
#Copyright Brandon Lucia 2010
#
#I wrote this program so I could listen to records in my living room.
#The main idea is that you connect something you want to hear somewhere
#else to your computer's default line in or microphone or whatever (the
#default input). 
#
#capture.sh does the audio acquire (using SoX) and mp3 encoding using lame.
#You need to install sox and lame before you can use this program.
#
#Once sox and lame work, just run StreamThru, with your audio source connected
#to the line input of your computer.
#
#Once StreamThru is running, fire up your favorite web browser, and point it
#at the computer that's running StreamThru at port 8000 (i.e., 192.168.1.1:8000)
#You should be hearing music.
#
#Sometimes getting the line levels correct is tricky.  Be sure that if you're
#amplifying your audio source you keep the input gain low on your computer.  If
#you don't, I don't think anything will break, but it just sounds like garbled
#static because it is receiving too much signal.
